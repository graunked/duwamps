This is an ongoing effort to digitize an 1899 map of Seattle.

The repo holds the work-in-progress [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org/) project, and the map I'm using.

The repo also holds a generated Minecraft world file, which you can use to talk around the terrain of Seattle circa 1899.

[Duwamps](http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=303) was the first name for the settlement that would become Seattle, on a miserable spit of dry land on the edge of the Duwamish mudflats.
